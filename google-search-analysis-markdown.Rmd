### What is this?

<div class="col-lg-4">

I downloaded and analyzed my entire available Google Search history. My Google history contains 39,040 searches since February 2nd, 2011 (spread across 24 JSON files). As we can see from the graph on the right, late 2015 was a busy time for me!

For instructions on downloading your own history, see https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en

</div>

<div class="col-lg-8">

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
master.plot.list[["GoogleSearchHistogram"]]
```

</div>

<div class="col-lg-12">

#### Once parsed, search history data looks like this:



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

knitr::kable(master.plot.list[["SampleDat"]])

```

This was right at the end of college when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Go to law school? Become a patent lawyer? Ah, to be young again!

### What time of day am I most productive?

#### It appears that my most productive time of the day is between 2-3 pm. Note how my workday has slowly gotten later and later since 2011. Also note the slight bump in traffic around 6-7pm. I am definitely a night owl. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
master.plot.list[["GoogleSearchHourly"]]
```

#### Wednesdays are particularly busy for me. 2015 and 2016 have been some of my busiest years to date.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8}
master.plot.list[["GoogleSearchWeekday"]]

```


### What is my busy time of year?


2015 saw a massive spike in search traffic late in the year. That was when I started my new job and was working hard to build out our proprietary database. That project worked out pretty well, but it also bruned me out. I can see this pattern in the data: large pushes to do big projects, followed by a decrease in productivity. Makes me wonder, could I monitor my search traffic as a proxy for my own health? 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

master.plot.list[["GoogleSearchDensity"]]

```

It is also interesting to see how large spikes in activity are often followed by gradual declines lasting up to 6 months (look at 2015 and 2016). It seems like I have 2 big projects in me per year, then I wind down / burn out for a while.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
master.plot.list[["GoogleSearchSeasonal"]]
```


### What time of year am I most productive?

#### My energy peaks in June. This chart also puts into context just how much of an outlier late 2015 was (the red dot in October). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
master.plot.list[["GoogleSearchBoxPlot"]]
```

#### 2016

2016 has been all about commercal real estate in New York City. One of the most common things I do now is search for new, novel data sources about a variety of topics, and have become better at the heavy-lifting data tasks like web scraping and parsing.
